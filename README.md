# UnitConverter

In this reposetory, you'll find 2 very simply PHP scripts. One of them converts miles to kilometers and kilometers to miles, while the other one converts kilograms to pounds and pounds to kilograms. 

They only use if/else if/else statements, echoing and user input so they're extremely simple.
